# Quantum Simulator in Rust

This project serves as a learning exercise to aid me in learning quantum computing as I read *Quantum Computing Since Democritus* by Scott Aaronson.


## Goals 

- Implement the most common quantum logic gates (currently only have cnot).
- Use complex numbers instead of floats for amplitudes (I haven't yet learned why this is necessary).
- Use the gates to simulate common quantum algorithms like Grover's and Shor's.
- Estimate the time complexity both for a classical computer and quantum computer.

This is an ongoing learning project. Not intended for serious use.
